## ⚡ Part I: Modern GenAI & LLMOps

### 🧩 1. Chunking Mechanisms in RAG

**Q:** What are the different chunking mechanisms used in RAG, and why do they matter?
**A:**
Chunking splits large documents into meaningful pieces for embedding and retrieval.

* **Fixed-size:** Simple token limits (e.g., 500 tokens).
* **Semantic:** Split by sentences or topic boundaries.
* **Recursive:** Hierarchical, meaning-based chunking.
* **Overlapping:** Add small overlaps to preserve continuity.
  💡 *Better chunking = fewer hallucinations + higher retrieval accuracy.*

### ⚙️ 2. Transformer Architecture

**Q:** What’s the key idea behind the Transformer architecture?
**A:**
Transformers replaced RNNs with **self-attention**, letting each token attend to every other token in parallel.
Core blocks: *embeddings → positional encodings → multi-head attention → feedforward → residuals → normalization.*
📘 **Encoder (BERT)** understands. **Decoder (GPT)** generates. **T5** does both.

---

### 🔧 3. LLM Fine-Tuning Mechanisms

**Q:** How do you fine-tune large language models efficiently?
**A:**
Use **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**:

* **LoRA:** Add low-rank adapters.

* **Parallelism:** Distribute across GPUs
* **Distillation:** Deploy smaller models
  🧠 *Think: cache, quantize, parallelize.*

### 🧱 6. Agentic AI Frameworks

**Q:** What are Agentic AI frameworks?
**A:**
Frameworks like **CrewAI**, **AutoGen**, and **TaskWeaver** orchestrate multiple specialized LLM agents that collaborate, use tools, and maintain memory to complete multi-step tasks.
💡 *Shift from reactive chatbots → proactive, reasoning systems.*

---

### 🧩 7. RAG Fundamentals

**Q1:** What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
**A:**
RAG connects an LLM to an external knowledge base via embeddings and vector search.
💡 *Preferred over fine-tuning for fast, cheap, and updatable domain knowledge.*

**Q2:** Why is RAG preferred over fine-tuning for enterprises?
**A:**
Avoids retraining, allows real-time knowledge updates, reduces hallucination, improves traceability.

**Q3:** Outline RAG data flow.
**A:**
User query → Query embedding → Vector search → Retrieve top chunks → Augment prompt → LLM generates grounded response.
💡 *Think: “Retrieve, then Read.”*

**Q4:** Key components of RAG system?
**A:**
Embedding model, vector store, retriever, prompt composer, LLM, evaluation/logging.

**Q5:** Limitations of RAG?
**A:**
Retrieval errors, poor chunking, latency, embedding drift, limited context window.
💡 *Mitigate with hybrid search, semantic chunking, and RAGAS.*

---

### 🧩 8. Prompt Optimization

**Q:** How do you optimize prompts for accuracy and cost?
**A:**
Clear, structured, parameterized templates.
Track versions (LangFuse).
Compress context, use smaller models for subtasks.
💡 *Prompt engineering = versioning + evaluation + clarity.*

---

### 🧭 9. LLM Observability

**Q:** What is LLM observability and why is it important?
**A:**
Tracks LLM performance, latency, and cost.
Metrics: recall@k, latency, token usage, feedback, faithfulness.
Tools: LangFuse, LangTrace, Prometheus, Grafana.
💡 *Observability = reliability + continuous learning.*

### 🔍 10. GenAI Evaluation

**Q:** How do you evaluate GenAI model responses?
**A:**

* **Offline:** RAGAS, TruLens, Giskard, human review.

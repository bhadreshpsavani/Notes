## ⚡ Part I: Modern GenAI & LLMOps

### 🧩 1. Chunking Mechanisms in RAG

**Q:** What are the different chunking mechanisms used in RAG, and why do they matter?
**A:**
Chunking splits large documents into meaningful pieces for embedding and retrieval.

* **Fixed-size:** Simple token limits (e.g., 500 tokens).
* **Semantic:** Split by sentences or topic boundaries.
* **Recursive:** Hierarchical, meaning-based chunking.
* **Overlapping:** Add small overlaps to preserve continuity.
  💡 *Better chunking = fewer hallucinations + higher retrieval accuracy.*

---

### ⚙️ 2. Transformer Architecture

**Q:** What’s the key idea behind the Transformer architecture?
**A:**
Transformers replaced RNNs with **self-attention**, letting each token attend to every other token in parallel.
Core blocks: *embeddings → positional encodings → multi-head attention → feedforward → residuals → normalization.*
📘 **Encoder (BERT)** understands. **Decoder (GPT)** generates. **T5** does both.

---

### 🔧 3. LLM Fine-Tuning Mechanisms

User query → Query embedding → Vector search → Retrieve top chunks → Augment prompt → LLM generates grounded response.
💡 *Think: “Retrieve, then Read.”*

**Q4:** Key components of RAG system?
**A:**
Embedding model, vector store, retriever, prompt composer, LLM, evaluation/logging.

**Q5:** Limitations of RAG?
**A:**
Retrieval errors, poor chunking, latency, embedding drift, limited context window.

Compress context, use smaller models for subtasks.
💡 *Prompt engineering = versioning + evaluation + clarity.*

---

### 🧭 9. LLM Observability

**Q:** What is LLM observability and why is it important?
**A:**
Tracks LLM performance, latency, and cost.
Metrics: recall@k, latency, token usage, feedback, faithfulness.
Tools: LangFuse, LangTrace, Prometheus, Grafana.
💡 *Observability = reliability + continuous learning.*

**A:**

* **Offline:** RAGAS, TruLens, Giskard, human review.
* **Online:** Log queries in LangFuse/LangTrace; use LLM-as-a-judge.
  💡 *Evaluation closes the feedback loop.*

---

### 🌐 11. Scaling and Deployment

### 🧩 16. LLM Text Generation Parameters

**Q:** What are the key text generation parameters in large language models (LLMs), and how do they affect output?

**A:**
These parameters control the *style*, *diversity*, and *determinism* of model responses.

* **`temperature`** – Controls randomness.

  * Low (≈0.1–0.3): Deterministic, factual answers.
  * High (≈0.8–1.0): Creative, varied outputs.
    💡 *Think of it as the model’s “spice level.”*

* **`top_k`** – Keeps only the top *k* most probable next tokens.

  * Small *k* (e.g., 20): Safer, focused text.
  * Large *k* (e.g., 100): More variety.
    💡 *Prunes the long tail of unlikely words.*

* **`top_p` (nucleus sampling)** – Chooses from smallest token set whose probabilities sum to *p*.

  * Common range: 0.8–0.95.
    💡 *Balances diversity and coherence more smoothly than top_k.*

* **`max_tokens`** – Caps output length.

  * Prevents runaway responses and controls cost.
    💡 *Useful for APIs with per-token pricing.*

* **`repetition_penalty` / `presence_penalty` / `frequency_penalty`** – Reduce repeated phrases or overused words.
  💡 *Encourages linguistic variety and discourages loops.*

* **`stop` tokens** – Define where generation should end.
  💡 *Useful for structured formats like JSON or conversations.*

* **`beam_search`** (less common in chat models) – Explores multiple likely continuations before choosing the best.
  💡 *Used for tasks needing precision over creativity.*

---

💡 *In short:*
`temperature` = creativity,
`top_p/top_k` = diversity filter,
`penalties` = repetition control,
`max_tokens` = budget guardrail.

🧠 *Mastering these dials turns you from a prompt engineer into a dialogue composer.*
